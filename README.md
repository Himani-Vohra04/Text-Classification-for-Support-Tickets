project implements an automated customer support ticket classification system using Natural Language Processing and machine learning. It is developed in Python using NLTK for text preprocessing, TF-IDF for feature extraction, and Logistic Regression from Scikit-learn for multi-class classification. The system efficiently categorizes support tickets into Network, Account, Payment, and Technical issues, helping improve response time and reduce manual effort.
